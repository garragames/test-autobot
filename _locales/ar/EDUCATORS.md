# MakeCode Extensions

Hello Super Educators!

We are thrilled to welcome you to **Garragames'** new MakeCode extensions documentation! As you probably know, 
here at **Garragames**, we're passionate about bringing the joy and accessibility of low-code programming to 
all learners, particularly those wonderful young minds in basic education.

Let's talk about what we mean by 'low-code', shall we? In short, it's all about simplifying the process of 
programming. You see, traditional coding can often be filled with complex syntax and intimidating blocks of 
code. But we believe that shouldn't be a barrier for our young learners who are just starting their exciting 
coding journey. That's why we develop tools that put the power of coding in their hands, even if they don't 
know what a "for loop" is yet. 

Our MakeCode extensions follows this low-code philosophy. We've cooked up some brand-new blocks that encapsulate
the more intricate operations, stripping away the complexity, yet maintaining the functionality. These blocks 
provide a delightful and accessible coding experience, opening up the world of programming without all the 
stumbling blocks. 

Our approach takes inspiration from brilliant platforms like **Scratch** and **MakeCode**, which use a visual 
approach to introduce coding concepts. Students can drag and drop, connect, and manipulate blocks to create code. 
They can see their code taking shape, understand the logical structure, and, best of all, watch the results 
in real-time. 

The beauty of our MakeCode extensions is that it allows students to create complex projects without having to 
delve into the more difficult aspects of programming that might otherwise be discouraging. Instead, they can 
focus on creative problem solving, designing, and understanding the fundamental concepts of programming. This 
way, we ensure that learning programming is not only approachable but also a whole lot of fun.

That said, this documentation will walk you through all you need to know to start using our new MakeCode 
extensions in your classroom. We've included step-by-step guides, examples, and troubleshooting tips to 
help you out along the way. Don't worry; we're in this together!

We are excited to be part of your students' coding journey and can't wait to see the wonderful things they'll 
create using **Garragames' MakeCode extensions**. Happy coding, educators! You're doing an amazing job!

Keep on being awesome,
The Garragames Team
